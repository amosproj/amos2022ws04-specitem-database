## Project Summary
### Project Vision
The development partnership AUTOSAR, consisting of several hundred member companies, establishes and provides standards for software, exclusively for automotive electronic control units. These standards are, for example, represented in the form of specification documents that contain technical requirements. The firm Develop Group is working with these documents and claims that the practical handling of them has potential to be facilitated. The objective of the "AMOS SpecItem project" is to provide the possibility to easily search, edit and compare the technical requirements present in the specification documents. This is realized with a specially created database whose content can be accessed in an interactive UI. The overall usability of the system is enhanced by its accessibility through communication protocols. Users of this solution benefit from an enormous facilitation in maintenance of the requirement items.

### Project Mission
Maintaining SpecItems is simplified by creating an online database with a browser-based frontend.
The user is able to view the SpecItems in the browser.
He can also search for specific SpecItems.
Moreover, the user can change SpecItems in the web browser.

So in other words the database (service) shall allow to:
- import new revisions of SpecItems from input files
- search and view SpecItem data in web-browser
- compare revisions of a SpecItem
- edit specific SpecItem metadata in web-browser
- export SpecItem data to output files
- trigger the actions above by REST API.
